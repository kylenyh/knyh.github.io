It showcases programming skills in Python, focusing on loops, conditionals, and data structure manipulation. The development process includes designing a user interface with **Pygame**, creating game mechanics and incorporating a scoring system. 

#### Crime Data Collection Survey - Associated with UCL (2<sup>nd</sup>)

Implemented through **Python**, this project involves designing and implementing a phone snatching survey system to gather and analyze data from the survey. The project integrates various libraries to efficiently collect, store, and process survey responses, aiming to provide insights into crime trends, plots and patterns. Through a user-friendly interface, participants can submit information anonymously, contributing to a comprehensive database that supports academic research and helps inform public safety strategies.

#### A* Algorithm - Personal (3<sup>rd</sup>)

Implemented through **Python**, this project focuses on the A* algorithm, which finds the shortest path between two points, considering various obstacles and optimizing the path based on cost functions. The algorithm combines features of **Dijkstra's algorithm** for the shortest path and the **Greedy Best-First-Search algorithm** to prioritize paths that seem more promising. 

#### Dijkstra Algorithm - Personal (4<sup>th</sup>)

Implemented through **Python**, this project is a practical implementation of a famous algorithm used for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph. The algorithm showcases how to efficiently traverse a graph, represented as weighted edges between nodes, to find the minimum distance from a starting point to all other points in the graph. 

#### Double Pendulum - Personal (5<sup>th</sup>)

Implemented through **Python**, this project explore the principles and dynamics of a chaotic double pendulum system through simulation. Utilizing **Pygame** and **Physics**, it visualizes the unpredictable motion of a pendulum with two segments.
