Currently studying **Crime and Security Science** at [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/), my academic path began at [St Joseph Institution International School in Malaysia](https://www.sji-international.edu.my/), through an IGCSE programme, before advancing to an accelerated foundation programme in **Computer Science** at the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/). 

My academic and professional interests converge at the nexus of **physics**, **cybersecurity** and **computer science**, exploring how technological advancements can bolster security measures and strategies against crime. From a scientific and technological perspective, my interests lie in the physics of nuclear weapons, the physics of particle accelerators, the physics of quantum computers, the physics of quantum hardware, the physics of rockets, the physics of fluids, the physics of semiconductors, the physics of lasers, the physics of nanotechnology, the Internet of Things, the achitecture of network systems, the achitecture of digital computers, the logic of quantum computers, the logic of quantum algorithms, the logic of quantum chips, the logic of quantum logic gates, the logic of computer science algorithms.

Outside my academic pursuits, I dedicate time to coding projects that challenge my skills and broaden my understanding of computing and programming principles. Additionally, I immerse myself in the realm of physics, often trying to learn quantum physics on my own and coming up with my computational physics projects if I can. As a football enthusiast, I enjoy not only following the sport but also watching football matches if I have the time. Travel also plays an integral role in my life, enriching my perspective with diverse cultures and societal structures. These personal endeavors not only provide balance but also fuel my personal growth and curiosity.
